# Degree-Planner
* This system is able to create and edit degree plans based on majors/minors/classes that are in the code.
* System was designed using MVC architecture.
* The system was not made to be maintainable, so changing one function may require changing other functions.
* Function robustness was made for the current system in mind, changes to one function may require additional robustness to be implemented in other functions.
